PALERA1N GUI WRITTEN IN PYTHON

* For macOS x86_64 only (For now).
* Launches palera1n commands in terminal.
* Now with built-in palera1n executable! (v1.0.2)
* Now with built-in Python Libraries! (v1.0.3)
* Truly a stand-alone app now. 
* To run the project from source, simply invoke via python3:

```sh
# Launch GUI
python3 Palera1n-GUI.py
```
* To build app from source yourself run:

```sh
# Install PyInstaller
pip3 install pyinstaller
# Move into project directory
cd ~/Palera1n-GUI
# Create the pyinstaller based Application
pyinstaller Palera1n-GUI.spec
# Open build folder
open ./dist/
```

* Once done, you'll find the application generated at `./dist/Palera1n-GUI.app`
